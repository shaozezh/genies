# Avatar animations

Any animations created for [humanoid avatars](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AvatarCreationandSetup.html) are compatible with Genies avatars. Although you will need to have some custom parameters included in any animator controller you use with the [`UserAvatar` component](LoadingAvatars.md#the-useravatar-component).

To create a new compatible animator controller right click anywhere within the *Project* window and chose `Create/Genies SDK/Avatar Animator Controller`. This will create an empty controller that includes our custom parameters used for facial animations. You can also add the parameters to any existing animator controller by right clicking on it and selecting `Genies SDK/Add face animation parameters`.

## Basic animation clips

Genies provides with some basic animation clips that you can use to with your animators.

## Facial animation support

There is no official support for facial animations yet. Some of our provided basic clips may contain facial animations.
